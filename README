== Welcome to Tillsammans

Mikael Rulez!!! oc > Mikael.

This is a simple RoR-based system we are developing on about one evening per week. Don't expect any rapid progress ;)

We are mainly doing this to learn and/or teach RoR and Flex.

== Getting Started

We use Vlad the Deployer for simplified deployment. First, tweak your config/deploy.rb to reflect 
your own setup, setup a shared/database.yml and possibly a shared/mongrel_cluster.yml

For convenience there are three extra vlad tasks: vlad:deploy, vlad:restart and vlad:db_config.

== Features

Currently: nothing ;)

We are planning to implement:
- A calender abstraction (Firstly for integration with Notes, in the future possibility of any iCal calendar)
- A authentication/SSO abstraction (currently uses our own REST-based authenticator service)
- IPhone interface
- Automatized localization
- Much more standard stuff.
